              As a recent graduate with a Master's degree in Software
              Engineering from Université Hassiba Benbouali de Chlef, my passion
              lies in the realm of secure systems. I firmly believe that the key
              to engineering robust security lies in adopting secure programming
              languages that proactively eliminate vulnerabilities, rather than
              solely relying on the programmer's diligence and caution. My
              academic journey at Université Hassiba Benbouali de Chlef has
              provided me with a solid foundation in software engineering
              principles, critical thinking, and problem-solving skills, all of
              which have nurtured my dedication to the field of secure systems.

            <p class="description">
              I am currently seeking a Ph.D. position that will allow me to
              contribute to the implementation of secure systems through the
              construction of reliable, secure, and expressive languages
              equipped with robust type systems. With my Master's degree in
              Software Engineering and a deep-rooted passion for secure systems,
              I am eager to embark on a research journey that explores
              innovative approaches to fortify the foundations of software
              security.
