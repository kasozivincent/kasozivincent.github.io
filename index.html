              As a recent graduate with a Master's degree in Software
              Engineering, my profound passion lies in the realm of secure
              systems. I firmly believe that the key to engineering robust
              security lies in adopting secure programming languages that
              proactively eliminate vulnerabilities, rather than solely relying
              on the programmer's diligence and caution.

              In essence, my journey as a recent software engineering Master's
              graduate has solidified my passion for secure systems. I firmly
              believe that the adoption of secure programming languages offers a
              transformative approach to engineering robust security. Driven by
              an unwavering commitment to academic excellence and a burning
              desire to revolutionize the field, I am poised to embark on a
              Ph.D. program that will empower me to shape the future of secure
              systems and establish a lasting impact in the domain of software
              security.
